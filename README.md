# EDA_ML_Rent_Brazil_House
Applying Machine Learning Models to Predict the Rent of Brazilian homes and Perform EDA

Using Public Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/rubenssjr/brasilian-houses-to-rent ,tried estabilishing correlaion between different features such as if house is furnished or not, area, no. of floors, count of Bathrooms, etc.
Out of the two files available in the dataset I used *houses_to_rent_v2.csv* .
I divided dataset into two parts test and train for training and testing of machine learning models. out of all the machine learning models tried, Linear Regression stands out as the best. I used R2 Error as a method of evaluating eccuracy.
